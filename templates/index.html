Welcome!
</p>
<p>
Alaska Writers is a community-focused site and chat server that owes its origins to <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a> and to the Fairbanks region, but which has grown beyond both of those to become a year-round community for the entire state.
</p>
<h3>The History</h3>
<p>
Many years ago, when Alaska was a single region in NaNoWriMo, one of the region's many MLs started a chat room on AIM where writers all over the state could join in and help cheer on everyone else while finding the motivation they needed as well to continue on and reach for that goal of 50,000 words. These were the halcyon days in which I first joined this wonderful annual endeavor.
Time passed, as it is wont to do, and things changed. Fairbanks found itself with no local ML, and scrambled to figure out how to coordinate local events. At the same time, the AIM chat room was abandoned, and a new one was formed on Skype.
The Fairbanks area found its feet again with a Facebook group created by one of our then-unofficial MLs, and it continued to be the Interior's main method of interaction. Facebook groups have lengthy and sometimes-awkward addresses, however, made worse if the group ever has to change its name; to address that, I purchased a simpler domain and set it up to forward visitors to the Facebook group.
</p>
<p>
Things were not all rosy, however. Skype as a multi-user chat platform is an abomination, especially when trying to join the room for the first time if you don't happen to already have a Skype buddy in the room to invite you. At the same time, the Alaska region was broken up to create separate regions for Anchorage, Fairbanks, and "Elsewhere", which, while great from a communication and organization point of view, fractured the feeling of unity that many Alaskan writers felt with one another, regardless of distance.
</p>
<p>
It was at about this time that I realized that I had the requisite knowledge to create a new chat server, one that could replace the abomination known as Skype for our needs, as well as provide tools to make using it easier and to even help writers with their stories. Since I had it handy, I used the same domain name I had bought to direct users to the Fairbanks region's Facebook group for this new service, and set up a basic website where people could register and then join the chat server. It was, of course, a completely inadequate name, as the target audience was always the entire state, as well as I later realized that it could be useful to keep the community going year-round. After a simple survey to get thoughts from others on a new name, the site and the chat server were re-launched as Alaska Writers, with a new mission to become a central hub not only for participants in NaNoWriMo in November, but for all writers throughout the year.

This is that site.
